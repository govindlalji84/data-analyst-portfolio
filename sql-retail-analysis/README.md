# Retail Sales & Payments Analysis (SQL)

This folder contains my SQL portfolio project using MySQL.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL client)
2. Run: `sql/schema.sql`  (creates tables + inserts sample data)
3. Run: `sql/queries.sql` (runs all analysis queries)

## 🧩 Notes
- Some orders intentionally have **no payment records** to support unpaid-order analysis.
- Payment statuses include **Completed / Pending / Failed / Refunded** for realistic reporting scenarios.
